General Plan Development Tool with Action Item Tracking and Alarming System

MiPlan is a highly customizable, browser-based action plan tracking tool that can send emails to responsible individuals automatically as target dates approach or are passed. MiPlan provides a mechanism to track large lists of action items on multiple plans simultaneously. Users can see the status of all items on plans of which they are a part, and owners of individual action items can change the status of completion of their items.

MiPlan is integrated with [openSPM](https://github.com/GridProtectionAlliance/openSPM) so that MiPlan can be used to track the completion of remediation plan action items that are required for NERC compliance.
